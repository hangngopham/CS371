This is your team project repository. All work should be done
in the "trunk" subdirectory, not here at the top level. If you 
have resources that you don't create, such as reference 
material for certain technologies, you can create another 
top-level directory such as "reference" and put those in there, 
but all of your own project work should be in "trunk".
